- Rust programming language setup on your system.
- Basic familiarity with compiling and running Rust applications.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rbnyng/rust_dark_chess
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd rust_dark_chess
    ```

### Running the Game

To compile and run the game, use the following command from the project directory:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

Or you can build it into an executable with:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

Alternatively there is a precompiled executable available.

## Gameplay Instructions

- The game starts with all pieces hidden. Players take turns to flip or move pieces.
- Pieces can only move to adjacent squares unless specified by their type (e.g., Chariots and Cannons have special movement rules).
- To capture an opponent's piece, move your piece to the same square. Capturing rules vary by piece type.
- The objective is to capture the opponent's General or to leave the opponent with no legal moves.

### Commands

- `flip <row> <col>`: Flips a hidden piece at the specified coordinates.
- `move <from_row> <from_col> <to_row> <to_col>`: Moves a piece from the starting coordinates to the destination coordinates.
- `exit`: Exits the game.
- `help`: Displays a help message with game instructions and commands.
- `undo`: Undo the last move.
- `state`: Prints the current game state in a simple text format.
- `history`: Prints the move history.
- `flip all`: (For Testing) Flips all hidden pieces on the board.

### Piece Capture Order and Special Rules

- General (將/帥): Can be captured by Soldiers (卒/兵) but cannot capture Soldiers directly.
- Advisor (士/仕), Elephant (象/相), Horse (馬/傌): Capture pieces of the same or lower rank, except the Soldier-General interaction.
- Chariot (車/俥): Moves and captures in any number of unblocked squares vertically or horizontally.
- Cannon (砲/炮): Moves like the Chariot (車/俥), can capture any piece by jumping over exactly one piece (of any type) along its movement path.
- Soldier (卒/兵): Can capture the General and pieces of the same or lower rank.
- The capture order from highest to lowest is General (將/帥) > Advisor (士/仕) > Elephant (象/相) > Chariot (車/俥) > Horse (馬/傌) > Cannon (砲/炮) > Soldier (卒/兵).

Note: The game supports two players: Red and Black. Players must alternate turns.
